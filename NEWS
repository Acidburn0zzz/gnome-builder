==============
Version 3.32.2
==============

Changes since last release:

 • Glade design view improvements.
 • Improve CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS discovery with compile_commands.json when
   a direct match is not found (such as with headers).
 • Improve symlink detection warning.
 • Fix block selection in terminals.
 • Enable VTE hyperlinks feature.
 • NPM build system bug fixes and improvements.
 • The diagnostic manager now properly tracks changes to a buffers configured
   source language. This will improve diagnostic detection in some situations.
 • rofiles-fuse and flatpak-builder will attempt to retire their corresponding
   host processes when flatpak is in use.
 • Unit tests will now properly run when uninstalled.
 • The unit tests panel now properly scrolls when a large amount of content
   is provided to the PTY.
 • The unit tests panel now allows for cancelling an ongoing unit test.
 • The file monitor now properly detects file changes when no version control
   is in use.
 • The clang plugin now discovers the location of the C++ standard includes.
 • Project template improvements.
 • Folder selection is fixed when cloning a repository.
 • menus.ui no longer is opened with the Glade design view by default.
 • "Open in Terminal" will now properly open a terminal from the host system
   instead of expecting flatpak bundling.
 • Updated documentation.
 • Updated translations.

==============
Version 3.32.1
==============

Changes since last release:

 • Appdata updates
 • The project-tree now auto-resizes the column
 • Stability improvements to the flatpak plugin
 • The flatpak plugin now queries before installing dependencies
 • The code-index can be avoided by placing a ".noindex" file in a directory
 • Transfer notifications have cancel buttons restored
 • Waf improvements
 • Flatpak uses fallback-x11 now instead of x11 by default
 • RLS support can now be disabled by disabling the plugin
 • A leak was fixed for semantic highlight indexes
 • Scroll improvements for the source code editor
 • Improved support for symlinks above the project directory
 • Support for podman's --preserve-fds option
 • Sourceview line number background drawing is improved
 • Updated documentation
 • Updated translations

==============
Version 3.32.0
==============

Changes since last release:

 • Improve restoring cursor after loading buffer
 • Various API changes to avoid out-params with async functions
 • Styling tweaks for matching brackets
 • Updated documentation
 • Updated translations

===============
Version 3.31.92
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Destroy various IdeObject after they are no longer needed reducing
   memory usage a bit
 • Add missing shortcuts to shortcuts window
 • Fix various compiler warnings for release builds
 • Tweak builder-dark style-scheme for Adwaita changes
 • Allow project-tree to be used from editor workspace
 • Allow gnome: gitlab: and github: prefixes when using --clone
 • Unit Tests now have a VTE-based output panel when running
 • Initial support for waf build system
 • Cached build targets are invalidated when build config changes
   which should help ensure that "Run" does not execute stale
   binaries
 • Changing devices now properly invalidates the build manager
 • A rofiles-fuse wrapper is provided when building for Flatpak
 • Scrolling with j/k/up/down in Vim mode is less jarring at line
   boundaries by avoiding additional scrolling
 • New jump list desktop actions are provided for GNOME shell
 • Avoid indexing large directories when not in project-mode
 • Updated translations

===============
Version 3.31.91
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Fix three-finger-swipe gesture in keyboard shortcuts.
 • Respect sort-directories-first gsetting in project-tree.
 • Icons for the newcomers initiative have updated.
 • Loading of custom gtksourceview style schemes has been restored.
 • gnome-builder -e will now open a new editor window.
 • Plugins can now add delay in "settling" the buffer before saving.
 • The git plugin will settle for updated line changes before the buffer
   can be saved. This fixes an issue with trim-spaces plugin not trimming
   all of the expected lines.
 • Builder's flatpak-based fusermount wrapper was simplified. This could
   use testing with regards to rofiles and flatpak-builder.
 • Various search workflow improvements.
 • The VCS file monitor now contains a sequence number that can be used to
   optimize some additional work such as installing a project. Builder will
   no longer install the project before each project Run unless a file within
   the project tree has changed. Projects that rely on external files will
   need to press "Build" before "Run" if only external files have changed.
 • Improvements to guessing language syntax when a buffer is created.
 • Add an experimental podman runtime provider. This is not enabled by
   default and we do not recommend enabling it at this time.
 • Updated translations.

Thanks to the many contributors that provided patches during this cycle!

===============
Version 3.31.90
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Appdata and icon updates.
 • Many bugs found from refactoring fallout have been fixed.
 • New plugin APIs have been added and some existing APIs tweaked
   as we stabilize for release.
 • Theme tweaks to match upcoming Adwaita changes.
 • gdb improvements including use of fewer deprecated MI commands.
 • The greeter has been redesigned and simplified.
 • The git gutter now more accurately displays line information.
 • Menus have been tweaked to more closely fit with GNOME 3.32 guidelines.
 • The code indexer was redesigned to provide progress and improved pausibility.
   We expect more changes before 3.32 to reduce overhead of larger projects.
 • Code indexers and ctags will delay initial indexing until a user operation
   has occurred like saving a file or a successful build.
 • LSP conformance improvements.
 • The project tree now provides some basic VCS information and allows
   switching branches using the context menu. This exposed a bug in libgit2-glib
   which has been fixed there too. We recommend packagers ensure that bug fix
   has landed in their libgit2-glib.
 • Updated translations.

Thanks to the many contributors that provided patches during this cycle!

==============
Version 3.31.4
==============

Changes since last release:

 • A large number of changes as part of refactoring the core of Builder.
 • Basic support for multiple workspace windows for a project. Such is useful
   in multi-monitor setups.
 • Add --clone, --greeter, --manifest, --editor command line options.
 • Opening files via .desktop mimetypes should no longer open a project,
   only the source file.
 • Various build system information has been coalesced into the project tree.
 • Many meson_options.txt changes including a number of plugin options
   were simplified.
 • Configuration view has been abstracted to allow plugins to extend build
   preferences.

We expect there to be a number of bugs found during the following releases
due to the magnitude of refactoring this cycle. We appreciate those taking
time to file good bug reports for us.

We also anticipate a lot of translation updates so translation teams may want
to get a head start sooner rather than later.
