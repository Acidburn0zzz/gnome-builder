Version 3.31.91
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Fix three-finger-swipe gesture in keyboard shortcuts.
 • Respect sort-directories-first gsetting in project-tree.
 • Icons for the newcomers initiative have updated.
 • Loading of custom gtksourceview style schemes has been restored.
 • gnome-builder -e will now open a new editor window.
 • Plugins can now add delay in "settling" the buffer before saving.
 • The git plugin will settle for updated line changes before the buffer
   can be saved. This fixes an issue with trim-spaces plugin not trimming
   all of the expected lines.
 • Builder's flatpak-based fusermount wrapper was simplified. This could
   use testing with regards to rofiles and flatpak-builder.
 • Various search workflow improvements.
 • The VCS file monitor now contains a sequence number that can be used to
   optimize some additional work such as installing a project. Builder will
   no longer install the project before each project Run unless a file within
   the project tree has changed. Projects that rely on external files will
   need to press "Build" before "Run" if only external files have changed.
 • Improvements to guessing language syntax when a buffer is created.
 • Add an experimental podman runtime provider. This is not enabled by
   default and we do not recommend enabling it at this time.
 • Updated translations.

Thanks to the many contributors that provided patches during this cycle!

===============
Version 3.31.90
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Appdata and icon updates.
 • Many bugs found from refactoring fallout have been fixed.
 • New plugin APIs have been added and some existing APIs tweaked
   as we stabilize for release.
 • Theme tweaks to match upcoming Adwaita changes.
 • gdb improvements including use of fewer deprecated MI commands.
 • The greeter has been redesigned and simplified.
 • The git gutter now more accurately displays line information.
 • Menus have been tweaked to more closely fit with GNOME 3.32 guidelines.
 • The code indexer was redesigned to provide progress and improved pausibility.
   We expect more changes before 3.32 to reduce overhead of larger projects.
 • Code indexers and ctags will delay initial indexing until a user operation
   has occurred like saving a file or a successful build.
 • LSP conformance improvements.
 • The project tree now provides some basic VCS information and allows
   switching branches using the context menu. This exposed a bug in libgit2-glib
   which has been fixed there too. We recommend packagers ensure that bug fix
   has landed in their libgit2-glib.
 • Updated translations.

Thanks to the many contributors that provided patches during this cycle!

==============
Version 3.31.4
==============

Changes since last release:

 • A large number of changes as part of refactoring the core of Builder.
 • Basic support for multiple workspace windows for a project. Such is useful
   in multi-monitor setups.
 • Add --clone, --greeter, --manifest, --editor command line options.
 • Opening files via .desktop mimetypes should no longer open a project,
   only the source file.
 • Various build system information has been coalesced into the project tree.
 • Many meson_options.txt changes including a number of plugin options
   were simplified.
 • Configuration view has been abstracted to allow plugins to extend build
   preferences.

We expect there to be a number of bugs found during the following releases
due to the magnitude of refactoring this cycle. We appreciate those taking
time to file good bug reports for us.

We also anticipate a lot of translation updates so translation teams may want
to get a head start sooner rather than later.

 • The code indexer and other plugins will now ignore the node_modules
   directory when the npm plugin has been loaded.
 • You can now specify a branch name other than "master" when cloning
   a git repository.
 • Plugins in ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins will have higher
   priority which simplifies the process of creating and testing new
   plugins out-of-tree such as when using Flatpak.
 • Correctness fixes in a number of plugins and libide.

 • A new "toggle-map" GAction allows quickly enabling the overview map.

 • Fixes for DTD and RNG processing in xml-pack plugin
 • Improvements to the vim-style search and replace command
 • Continued improvements to the new sysroot plugin
 • A new IdeToolchain abstraction has been added to help with systems
   where multiple toolchains can exist within a runtime. We expect this
   to be used later on for some cross-compiling.
 • Various build systems have been migrated to toolchain support
 • Various memory leak fixes
 • Improved support for using subprocesses to perform compiler work
 • Clang support has been moved out-of-process using the new
   gnome-builder-clang subprocess. Clang-based auto-completion is temporarily
   disabled until a future development release.

 • The code-indexer now uses less memory
 • The highlighter can now deal with delayed requests to load a new
   highlight index. It more correctly follows up on incorrectly highlighted
   lines of code.
 • A spinloop was fixed when opening certain files with double-click from
   the project tree.

==============
Version 3.29.1
==============

Changes since last release:

 • A new threadpool and tasking engine has landed which provides
   much more safety guarantees in how tasks are processed off
   main-thread and results proxied back to the destination thread.
   This greatly improves the guarantees we can provide to threaded
   workers. Threadpools are segmented by type kind of work, and tasks
   can be pinned to certain threadpools to choke the number of concurrent
   tasks in flight.
 • Most subsystems have now been ported to IdeTask to take advantage of
   our new threading engine.
 • A new "Runtime Terminal" shell has been provided which is a terminal
   in the runtime environment of the application. This means that
   desktop applications will have access to the wayland or X11 sockets
   if configured to do so in the flatpak manifest.
 • Builder tries harder to ignore minified JSON files when performing
   various background work like TODO extraction.
 • The buffer manager now short-circuits a file-save request when the
   buffer has not changed from the on-disk version.
 • The build manager tries to avoid rediagnosing in a number of situations.
 • The code-indexer interface has been improved to support off-main-thread
   indexing in an asynchronous manner. Clang and Vala indexers have been
   improved to support this.
 • A new sysroot plugin has been added to allow building against an alternate
   sysroot than that of the host system. We expect further expansion in this
   area for toolchain selection in the future.
 • A new ctrl+shift+k keybinding has been added to jump to symbol search
   within the current document.
 • Many API improvements to simplify access from language bindings.
 • Flatpak "simple" build systems now run the commands from the srcdir
   matching more closely to what flatpak-builder will do.
 • XML plugin improvements for performance, stability and DTD tracking.
 • GDB integration now properly updates frames for the selected thread.
 • Various terminal improvements.
 • Various memory leak fixes.
 • The build manager tries to avoid reseting the build pipeline in
   certain situations.
 • Support for rofiles-fuse has been added to speed up flatpak cachepoint
   generation.
 • Improvements to build flag parsing across entire directories.
