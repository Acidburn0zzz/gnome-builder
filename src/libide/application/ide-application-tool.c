/**
 * SECTION:ide-application-tool
 * @title: IdeApplicationTool
 * @short_description: Implement command-line tools for Builder
 *
 * Builder supports running in "command-line" mode when executed like
 * "gnome-builder -t cli". If you use Builder from flatpak, this may be
 * activated like "flatpak run org.gnome.Builder -t cli".
 *
 * We suggest users that want to use this feature often to alias the
 * command in their shell such as "alias ide="gnome-builder -t cli".
 *
 * When running Builder in this mode, a number of command line tools can
 * be used instead of the full Gtk-based user interface.
 *
 * Plugins can implement this interface to provide additional command-line
 * tools. To be displayed in user help, you must also specify the name
 * such as "X-Tool-Name=foo" in your plugin's .plugin manifest. You should
 * also provide "X-Tool-Description=description" to notify the user of what
 * the tool does.
 *
 * Since: 3.32
